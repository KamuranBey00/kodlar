    <h1>The GodFather</h1>
    <p>
      The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family
      in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's
      youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding.
      Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business.
      Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but
      is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous
      rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito
      refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values
      and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most
      reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families
      which could tear the Corleone family apart
