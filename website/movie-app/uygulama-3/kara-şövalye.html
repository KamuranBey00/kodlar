    <h1>The Dark Knight</h1>
    <p>
      Set within a year after the events of Batman Begins (2005), Batman,
      Lieutenant James Gordon, and new District Attorney Harvey Dent
      successfully begin to round up the criminals that plague Gotham City,
      until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only as "The
      Joker" appears in Gotham, creating a new wave of chaos. Batman's struggle
      against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to "confront
      everything he believes" and improve his technology to stop him. A love
      triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel Dawes
